                    <h2>1. Collection and Use of Information</h2>
                    <h3>1.1 goISP Service</h3>
                    <p>When you connect the goISP Service, you will be asked to provide us with your phone number and name and you will allow us access to your mobile device's address book.</p>
                    
                    <p>A copy of the phone numbers and names in your address book (but not emails, notes or any other Personal Information in your address book) will be stored on our servers and will only be used to:
                    
                    <br>(a) inform you when your logs turn active on goISP,
                   <br>(b) specify which of your logs is already a goISP user,
                    <br>(c) precisely show the name of every contact as it is in your address book when you receive a call.
                    <br>(d) sync your logs with goISP running on any other platform.
                    <br>If you delete your address book which contains names and phones, from our servers, it will be deleted permanently straightaway. This is because the copy of your address book is stored on a live database which does not have a "historical backup".
                    
                    <br>Your phone number, which will be verified via a passcode that will be sent to you, will be used for identification purposes as your goISP user ID.
                    
                   <br>As other goISP users may add your goISP number to their address book and see that you registered to goISP, we do not consider the fact that your goISP number exists on goISP as private information.
                    
                    <br>goISP also maintains a Call Detail Record (CDR - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_detail_record) for each message and call that goes through the system. These are industry standard records used by all phone companies. We maintain this information in order to better understand network behavior and trends (numbers of messages and calls made by users, typical destinations, call lengths, network type, etc.), detect potential outages and technical issues (this helps us notice things like a drop in call volume in a certain geography, a shift in call length, a change in typical networks, etc.) and for public safety reasons. All log analysis is done in an anonymous, aggregate, non-personally identifiable manner. We may look into a specific Call Detail Record in response to a customer support request. We maintain CDRs for a period of no more than 30 months.
                    
                   <br>Audio calls by users are transmitted either directly from user to user or, if direct transmission is not possible (due to, for example, firewalls), goISP servers are used to transmit the call. In the latter scenario, the information transmitted is stored briefly in volatile memory (RAM) solely to enable the transmission of the call to the other user. WE DO NOT RECORD ANY PART OF YOUR CALL.
                    
                    <br>It might be necessary for goISP to interrelate with your phone's SMS inbox or call history for the lone purpose of service activation, placing incoming messages in your inbox, reading the contents of the activation SMS sent to you by goISP. WE WILL NOT ACCESS THE CONTENTS OF ANY OTHER SMS.</p>
                    
                    <h3>1.2 Information We Receive About You</h3>
                    <p>We receive a number of different types of information about you, including:</p>
                    
                    <h2>Your Information</h2>
                    
                    <p>Your information is the information that's required when you sign up for the site, as well as the information you choose to share.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Registration information:</h2>
                    
                     <p>When you sign up for goISP, you are required to provide information such as your name, email address, birthday, gender and your telephone number. Information you choose to share:
                     <br>Your information also includes the information you choose to share on goISP, such as when you post a status update, upload a photo, or comment on a friend's story.
                     <br>It also includes the information you choose to share when you communicate with us, such as when you contact us using an email address, or when you take an action, such as when you add a friend, like a Circle or a Group, add a place to your posts, use our contact importers or share other updates and uploads.
                    
                     <br>Your name, profile pictures, cover photos, gender, networks, username and User ID are treated just like information you choose to make public.
                    
                     <br>Your birthday allows us to do things like show you age-Serviceropriate content.</p>
                    
                    <h3>1.3 Name and Photo</h3>
                     <p>If you provide your name and/or photo it will be visible to other goISP users as long as:
                     <br>
                    
                    Such users have your goISP number, or
                    <br>
                    
                    You participate in the same Group with the users
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>1.4 Location Information</h3>
                     <p>Location related information may be passed out by your device which might be used by goISP to provide the specific service. However, you can choose their location information not to be shared.
                    
                     <br>goISP allows you to attach your location information to messages you send to other users or send a specific location message. If you choose to share your location with a specific user or group of users, your location will be retrieved from your device and sent to goISP. goISP will only use this location for this particular purpose and delete it from its servers once the message is delivered. For the avoidance of doubt, goISP will not share your location information and will not use it for any purpose except the one specifically requested by you.</p>
                    
                    <h2>1.5 Use of Other User Information</h2>
                     <p>In order to provide a more vibrant social experience, you might be asked to provide additional information which might include full name, display names, photos, messages, birth date etc. It is also possible for other users to visit and view profiles and other information which might include text, images, and videos etc. which have been submitted by the users themselves in order to share with others. Even though you might decide not to submit such information which is permissible, however, this might result in disabling you to avail all or parts of the features of goISP.</p>
                    
                    <h3>1.6 Use of Logs</h3>
                    <p> While using goISP, your log related information such as IP address, browser kind, browser name, browser language etc. will be collected and stored as an automatic process. The obtained information can be used by goISP to enhance the service standards offered and also take measures against harmful practices which create disturbance within regular service process.</p>
                    
                    <h3>1.7 Use of Device Related Information</h3>
                    <p> The device used by you carries information such as Operating System type, Hardware information, Serial number etc. which might be collected by goISP. The obtained information can be used by goISP to enhance the service standards offered and also take measures against harmful practices which create disturbance within regular service process.
                    
                     <br>In the event we make message boards and forums available to you (collectively, "Forums"), you will be solely responsible for the information and any other content you post on and through these Forums and should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose Personal Information (e.g., name, e-mail address, telephone number) on or through these Forums, such information is generally accessible to, and may be collected and used by other users.

                    monitor and understand the use of our products and services; and,
                    <br>
                    
                    secure you, others and the goISP internet services.

                    Please read our cookie policy below to learn more about the information we store and how it can be used.</p>
                    
                    <h2>1.9 Other Information We Receive About You</h2>
                     <p>We also receive other types of information about you:
                     <br>
                    
                    We receive data about you whenever you use or are running goISP, such as when you look at another person's timeline, send or receive a message, search for a friend or a Circle, click on, view or otherwise interact with things, using the goISP Service.
                    <br>
                    When you post things like photos or videos on goISP, we may receive additional related data (or metadata), such as the time, date, and place you took the photo or video.
                    <br>
                    We receive your IP address and other related information you use to connect goISP internet or to access goISP, including when multiple users log in from the same device. This may include network and communication information, such as your IP address or mobile phone number, and other information about things like your internet service, operating system, location, the type (including identifiers) of the device or browser you use, or the pages you visit. For example, we may get your GPS or other location information so we can tell you if any of your friends are nearby, or we could request device information to improve how our internet work on your device.
                    <br>
                    We receive data whenever you visit a game, internet services, or website that uses goISP Platform or visit a site with a goISP feature (such as a social plugin), sometimes through cookies. This may include the date and time you visit the site; the web address, or URL, you're on; technical information about the IP address, browser and the operating system you use; and, if you are logged in to goISP, your User ID.
                    <br>
                    We also put together data from the information we already have about you, your friends, and others, so we can offer and suggest a variety of services and features. For example, we may make friend suggestions, pick stories for your newsfeed, or suggest people to tag in photos. We may put together your current city with GPS and other location information we have about you to, for example, tell you and your friends about people or events nearby, or offer deals to you in which you might be interested. We may also put together data about you to serve you ads or other content that might be more relevant to you.
                    <br>
                    When we get your GPS location, we put it together with other location information we have about you (like your current city). But we only keep it until it is no longer useful to provide you services, like keeping your last GPS coordinates to send you relevant notifications.</p>

                    <h3>1.11 Information Others Share About You</h3>
                    <p>We receive information about you from your friends and others, such as when they upload your contact information, post a photo of you, tag you in a photo or status update, or at a location, or add you to a Group.
                    <br>
                    When people use goISP, they may store and share information about you and others that they have, such as when they upload and manage their invitations and logs.</p>
                    
                   <h3>1.12 Public Information
                    <p>When we use the phrase "public information", we mean the information you choose to make public, as well as information that is always publicly available.
                    
                    <h3>1.13 Information You Choose to Make Public</h3>
                    <p>Choosing to make your information public is exactly what it sounds like: anyone, including people not associated with goISP, will also be able to see it.
                    <br>
                    Choosing to make your information public also means that this information:
                    <br>
                    can be associated with you (i.e., your name, profile pictures, cover photos, timeline, User ID, username, etc.) even off goISP;
                    <br>
                    can show up when someone does a search on goISP or on a public search engine;
                    <br>
                    will be accessible to the goISP-integrated games, internet servicess, and websites you and your friends use; and
                    <br>
                    Sometimes you will not be able to select an audience when you post something. This is because some types of stories are always public stories. As a general rule, you should assume that if you do not see a sharing icon, the information will be publicly available.
                    <br>
                    When others share information about you, they can also choose to make it public.</p>
                    
                    <h3>1.14 Information that is Always Publicly Available</h3>
                   <p> The types of information listed below are always publicly available, and they are treated just like information you decided to make public:
                   <br>
                    
                    Name:
                    <br>
                    
                    o This helps your friends and family to find you.
                    <br>
                    Profile Pictures and Cover Photos:
                    <br>
                    o These help your friends and family to recognize you. If you are uncomfortable in making any of these photos public, you can always delete them. Unless you delete them, when you add a new profile picture or cover photo, the previous photo will remain public in your profile picture or cover photo album.
                    <br>
                    Networks:
                    <br>
                    o This helps you to see with whom you will be sharing information before you choose your audience. If you are uncomfortable making your network public, you can leave the network.
                    <br>
                    Gender:
                    <br>
                    o This allows us to refer to you properly.
                    <br>
                    Username and User ID:
                    <br>
                    o These allow you to give out a custom link to your timeline or Page, receive email at your goISP email address, and help make goISP Platform possible.</p>
                    
                    <h2>2. Sharing and Disclosure of Information</h2>

                    <h3>2.2 How We Use the Information We Receive</h3>
                    <p>We use the information we receive about you in connection with the services and features we provide to you and other users like your friends, and the developers that build the games, internet servicess, and websites you use. For example, in addition to helping people see and find things that you do and share, we may use the information we receive about you:
                    <br>
                    
                    as part of our efforts to keep goISP products, services and integrations safe and secure;
                    <br>
                    to protect goISP's or others' rights or property;
                    <br>
                    to provide you with location features and services, like telling you and your friends when something is going on nearby;
                    <br>
                    to make suggestions to you and other users on goISP, such as: suggesting that your friend to use our contact importer because you found friends using it, suggesting that another user adds you as a friend because the user imported the same email address as you did, or suggesting that your friend tag you in a picture they have uploaded with you in it; and
                    <br>
                    for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research and service improvement.
                    <br>
                    As you grant us the permission to use your information, it helps us to provide you with better service features and further improve our offerings for the future. While you are allowing us to use the information we receive about you, you always own all of your information. Your trust is important to us, which is why we don't share information we receive about you with others unless we have:
                    <br>
                    received your permission;
                    <br>
                    given you notice, such as by telling you about it in this policy; or
                    <br>
                    removed your name and any other personally identifying information from it.
                    <br>
                    Of course, for information that others share about you, they control how it is shared. We store data for as long as it is necessary to provide products and services to you and others, including those described above. Typically, information associated with your account will be kept until your account is deleted. For certain categories of data, we may also tell you about specific data retention practices.
                    <br>
                    We may enable access to public information that has been shared through our services.
                    <br>
                    We may allow service providers to access information so they can help us provide services.</p>
                    
                   <h2>3. Taking Control of Your Actions</h2>
                    <h3>3.1 Control Each Time You Post</h3>
                    <p>Whenever you post content (like a status update, photo or check-in), you can select a specific audience, or even customize your audience.
                    <br>
                    It is highly recommended that you always think before you post. Just like anything else you post on the web or send in an email, information you share on goISP can be copied or shared by anyone who can see it.
                    <br>
                    Although you choose with whom you share, there may be ways for others to determine information about you. For example, if you hide your birthday so no one can see it on your timeline, but friends post "hServicey birthday!" on your timeline, people may determine your birthday.
                    <br>
                    When you comment on or like someone else's story, or write on their timeline, that person gets to select the audience. For example, if a friend posts a Public story and you comment on it, your comment will be Public. Often, you can see the audience someone selected for their story before you post a comment; however, the person who posted the story may later change their audience. So, if you comment on a story, and the story???s audience changes, the new audience can see your comment.
                    <br>
                    Sometimes you will not see a sharing icon when you post something (like when you write on a Page's wall or comment on a news article that uses our comments plugin). This is because some types of stories are always public stories. As a general rule, you should assume that if you do not see a sharing icon, the information will be publicly available.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3.2 Control Over Your Timeline</h3>
                   <p> Whenever you add things to your timeline you can select a specific audience, or even customize your audience.
                    <br>
                    When you select an audience for your friend list, you are only controlling who can see the entire list of your friends on your timeline. Your friend list is always available to the games, internet servicess and websites you use, and your friendships may be visible elsewhere (such as on your friends' timelines or in searches).
                    <br>
                    Similarly, if you choose to hide your gender, it only hides it on your timeline. This is because we, just like the internet servicess you and your friends use; need to use your gender to refer to you properly on the site.
                    <br>
                    When you hide things on your timeline, like posts or connections, it means those things will not Serviceear on your timeline. But, remember, anyone in the audience of those posts or who can see a connection may still see it elsewhere, like on someone else's timeline or in search results. You can also delete your posts or change the audience of content you post.
                    <br>
                    People on goISP may be able to see mutual friends, even if they cannot see your entire list of friends. Some things (like your name, profile pictures and cover photos) do not have sharing icons because they are always publicly available. As a general rule, you should assume that if you do not see a sharing icon, the information will be publicly available.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3.3 Finding You on goISP</h3>
                    <p>To make it easier for your friends to find you, we allow anyone with your contact information (such as email address or telephone number) to find you through the goISP search bar as well as other tools we provide, such as contact importers - even if you have not shared your contact information with them on goISP.
                    <br>
                    You can choose who can look up your timeline using the email address or telephone number you added to your timeline through your privacy settings. . But remember that people can still find you or a link to your timeline on goISP through other people and the things they share about you or through other posts, like if you are tagged in a friend's photo or post.
                    <br>
                    Your settings do not control whether people can find you or a link to your timeline when they search for content they have permission to see, like a photo or other story in which you've been tagged.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3.4 Access on Phones and Other Devices</h3>
                   <p> Once you share information with your friends and others, they may be able to sync it with or access it via their mobile phones and other devices. For example, if you share a photo on goISP, someone viewing that photo could save it using goISP tools or by other methods offered by their device or browser. Similarly, if you share your contact information with someone or invite someone, they may be able to use goISP or third-party internet servicess or devices to sync that information. Or, if one of your friends has a goISP internet services on one of their devices, your information (such as the things you post or photos you share) may be stored on or accessed by their device.
                    <br>
                    You should only share information with people you trust because they will be able to save it or re-share it with others, including when they sync the information to a device.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3.5 Your Own Feed</h3>
                    <p>Your own feed is your activity log where you can go to view most of your information on goISP, including things you've hidden from your timeline. You can use this to manage your content. For example, you can do things like delete stories, change the audience of your stories or stop an internet services from publishing to your timeline on your behalf.
                    <br>
                    When you hide something from your timeline, you are not deleting it. This means that the story may be visible elsewhere, like in your friends' News Feed. If you want to delete a story you posted, choose the delete option.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3.6 What Your Friends and Others Share About You</h3>
                    <p>Anyone can add a link to a story. Links are references to something on the Internet; anything from a website to a Page or timeline on goISP.

A clear gif may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a Web page or message to other information about you, including your Personal Information.
